### Lectures & Lesroosters 



### Algoritmes 

randomisation

multiple hill climber algorithms 

- compare baseline with the initial algorithm and final algorithm
    - keep in mind the bias we apply

#### baseline

- theorertical optimum?? 
    - is it possible?

### Results

- time is not important factor, as long as it doesnt take too long eg 6 months
- still keep in mind the time -- which hardware gave the time 
- keep in mind how many moves the hill climber did

- how to get these specific results from our project using the o
python3 rooster.py

produces a visual timetable
